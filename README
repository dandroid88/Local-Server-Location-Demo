This project demos how one could autolocate a server on a LAN using jQuery and a python (django) server.

Example Use Case:
One usage scenario might be to host this page on an external website.  Say someone has a device on thier network but they don't know what its IP is or how to find it, this site/script would solve their problem.  

Warning:
Realize that with this example server configuration, your LAN topology is partially exposed. Only do this if you understand the risk of this exposure.
